# Microsponsors.io ERC721 Contract - DEMO
For the 0x.org Hackathon - Feb 2019

NOTE:
This is a very rough draft for demonstration purposes only, and is not by any means feature-complete or ready for production.

This demo uses ERC721 NFTs as a marketplace for sponsorship of content creators.

Each token is a Non-Fungible Token (NFT) that represents a time window during
which a content creators' ad property is available to rent by sponsors.
Non-Fungible tokens are used for this use-case because each sponsorship
slot has a unique value that the marketplace will find, and that value will 
change given its time window.

Patterned after 0x Sample ERC721 ABI:

## Testing

## Local Dev Test Setup
In a terminal, fire up ganache:
```
$ ganache-cli -p 8545
```

In another terminal, deploy contract
```
$ rm -rf build  <-- if there's stale junk in /build dir from old deployments
$ truffle compile
$ truffle migrate --network development
```

Fire up truffle console:
```
$ truffle console --network development

> Microsponsors.deployed().then(instance => { i = instance })
> u0 = web3.eth.accounts[0]
> u1 = web3.eth.accounts[1]
> u2 = web3.eth.accounts[2]
```

1. Test `.mint()`:

```
> i.mint(u1, 'sampleProperty', 1548890806025)
... log output should show 2 events: PropertyCreated, Minted
```

2. Test ERC721 view methods:
```
> i.ownerOf(0)` // 0 being id of the SponsorSlot created by u1
```
... should return u1 address

```
i.balanceOf(u1)
```
... should return 1 (as Big Number)

```
> i.totalSupply()
```
... should return 1 (as Big Number)

```
> i.tokensOfOwner(u1)
```
... returns array of BigNumbers representing token ids

```
i.getPropertyNameFromToken(0)
```
... returns property name from token with id of 0

3. Test ERC721 .transfer() from owner
```
> i.transfer(u2, 0, { from: u1 })
```
Owner is u1, transfers SponsorSlot to u2.

```
> i.ownerOf(0)
```
... should return u2's address now

4. Test ERC721 .transfer() from non-owner -- should fail

Try the same .transfer, but now u1 is no longer the owner
```
> i.transfer(u2, 0, { from: u1 })
```
... should throw exception and revert


5. Test ERC721 .transferFrom() without authorizing first -- should fail

Owner is u2 but has not approve()'d u1 to transfer token back to themselves
```
> i.transferFrom(u2, u1, 0, { from: u1 })
```
... should throw exception and revert


6. Test ERC721 .transferFrom()

Owner u2 approves token to be transferred back to u1
```
> i.approve(u1, 0, {from: u2})
```
... success, 'Approval' event is logged

u1 calls .transferFrom() successfully
```
> i.transferFrom(u2, u1, 0, { from: u1 })
```
... success, 'Transfer' event is logged

Double check that token was transferred successfully:
```
> i.ownerOf(0)
```
... should be u1

Check balances of each user:
```
> i.balanceOf(u0)` // ... should be 0
> i.balanceOf(u1)` // ... should be 1
> i.balanceOf(u2)` // ... should be 0
```

Check total supply:
```
> i.totalSupply() // ... should be 1
```
